Here are some discussion questions related to understanding the constructors in the `IceCreamSundae` class:

1. **Default Values**: Why might the default constructor assign specific default values like "Vanilla" for flavor and "Chocolate Syrup" for topping? How do these defaults affect object instantiation?

2. **Optional Features**: In the constructors that initialize `whippedCream` and `cherry`, why are these set to `false` by default in Constructors 1 and 2? What implications does this have for the functionality or use cases of the class?

3. **Price Variations**: Notice that the price differs between Constructor 1 and Constructor 2. Discuss how the pricing strategy for initializing objects might reflect the additional customization options.

4. **Use Cases**: Under what circumstances would you use Constructor 2 instead of Constructor 1 or Constructor 3? Discuss the benefits of having multiple constructors for the same class.

5. **Constructor Overloading**: What is constructor overloading, and how is it demonstrated in this class? What are the advantages and potential pitfalls of using overloaded constructors?

6. **Field Immutability**: Could any of the fields be made immutable given the current constructors? Discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of making certain fields immutable.

7. **Redundancy and Efficiency**: Do any of the constructors share common logic that could be refactored for efficiency? Consider how delegation between constructors could potentially reduce redundancy.

8. **Design Considerations**: If additional properties were to be added to the `IceCreamSundae` class, how might the existing constructors need to change to accommodate these new properties?

9. **Modification Needs**: What modifications might be required on the client side if a new constructor is added or an existing one is modified? How does constructor design impact users of this class?

10. **Business Logic Encapsulation**: How could adding business logic to these constructors (e.g., validating the price or setting maximum limits for each field) impact the class design and its robustness?

11. **Discussion on Getters and Setters**: While getters and setters are mentioned but not implemented, how might their inclusion affect the encapsulation and data validation aspect of the classâ€™s design? 

These questions can be used for classroom discussions to deepen students' understanding of constructors and object-oriented design principles.
